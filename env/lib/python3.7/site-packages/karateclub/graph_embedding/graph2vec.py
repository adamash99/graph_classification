    r"""An implementation of `"Graph2Vec" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05005>`_
    from the MLGWorkshop '17 paper "Graph2Vec: Learning Distributed Representations of Graphs".
    The procedure creates Weisfeiler-Lehman tree features for nodes in graphs. Using
    these features a document (graph) - feature co-occurence matrix is decomposed in order
    to generate representations for the graphs.

    The procedure assumes that nodes have no string feature present and the WL-hashing
    defaults to the degree centrality. However, if a node feature with the key "feature"
    is supported for the nodes the feature extraction happens based on the values of this key.

    Args:
        wl_iterations (int): Number of Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations. Default is 2.
        attributed (bool): Presence of graph attributes. Default is False.
        dimensions (int): Dimensionality of embedding. Default is 128.
        workers (int): Number of cores. Default is 4.
        down_sampling (float): Down sampling frequency. Default is 0.0001.
        epochs (int): Number of epochs. Default is 10.
        learning_rate (float): HogWild! learning rate. Default is 0.025.
        min_count (int): Minimal count of graph feature occurrences. Default is 5.
        seed (int): Random seed for the model. Default is 42.
        erase_base_features (bool): Erasing the base features. Default is False.
